- The extrusion process for making Textured Vegetable Protein (TVP) typically requires a die temperature ranging from https://www.bing.com/search?form=SKPBOT&q=120%C2%B0C%20to%20180%C2%B0C (248°F to 356°F) https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10068-022-01207-8. This temperature range helps achieve the desired texture and expansion properties of the TVP. The exact temperature can vary depending on the specific formulation and equipment used https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10068-022-01207-8.
